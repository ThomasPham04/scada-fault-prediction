PROJECT: DEVELOPING A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR EQUIPMENT FAULT PREDICTION USING SCADA DATA
Description

This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to predict industrial equipment failures using data collected from SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. SCADA data contains numerous sensor signals—such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, and flow rate—that can be leveraged to detect early signs of malfunction, prevent production downtime, and reduce maintenance costs.

Requirements

Theoretical Research: Study the characteristics of SCADA data and deep learning techniques such as RNN, LSTM, GRU, and CNN.

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Perform normalization, missing data detection, and extraction of relevant features.

Model Development:

LSTM/GRU for time-series prediction.

CNN or hybrid CNN–LSTM for capturing complex patterns.

Model Training & Evaluation: Train models using real or simulated SCADA data. Evaluate performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and RMSE.

Practical Application: Build a prototype system capable of real-time fault prediction and integrate an early-warning alert module.
